PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
After a silence of more than three years, due to other
engrossing occupations, the writer once more appeals to
his readers with a volume in which the leading features
of his former works will probably be found combined.
The story of "Odatis" is derived from Athenæus.  That
of "Clytæmnestra in Paris" follows accurately, in all
matters of fact, the evidence given in the well-known
Fenayrou trial of August, 1882.  The "Three Breton
Poems" are from the "Barzaz Breiz."  One of them,
"The Foster Brother," has, as the author has learnt
since his version was written, already appeared in a
volume of Translations from the same source, published
some years ago.

  PICTURES&mdash;I.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Above the abysmal undivided deep<br />
  A train of glory streaming from afar;<br />
  And in the van, to wake the worlds from sleep,<br />
  One on whose forehead shines the Morning-Star.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Long-rolling surges of a falling sea,<br />
  Smiting the sheer cliffs of an unknown shore;<br />
  And by a fanged rock, swaying helplessly<br />
  A mast with broken cordage&mdash;nothing more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Three peaks, one loftier, all in virgin white,<br />
  Poised high in cloudland when the day is done,<br />
  And on the mid-most, far above the night,<br />
  The rose-red of the long-departed sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A wild girl reeling, helpless, like to fall,<br />
  Down a hushed street at dawn in midsummer;<br />
  And one who had clean forgot their past and all,<br />
  From a lit palace casement looks at her.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A young man, only clothed with youth's best bloom,<br />
  In mien and form an angel, not in eye;<br />
  Hard by, a fell worm creeping from a tomb,<br />
  And one, wide-eyed, who cries, "The Enemy!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A lake of molten fires which swell and surge<br />
  And fall in thunders on the burning verge;<br />
  And one a queen rapt, with illumined face,<br />
  Who doth defy the Goddess of the place.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Eros beneath a red-cupped tree, asleep,<br />
  And floating round him, like to cherubim,<br />
  Fair rosy laughter-dimpled loves, who peep<br />
  Upon the languid loosened limbs of him.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A darkling gateway, thronged with entering ghosts,<br />
  And a grave janitor, who seems to say:<br />
  "Woe, woe to youth, to life, which idly boasts;<br />
  I am the End, and mine the appointed Way."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A young Faun making music on a reed,<br />
  Deep in a leafy dell in Arcady:<br />
  Three girl-nymphs fair, in musing thought take heed<br />
  Of the strange youth's mysterious melody.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A flare of lamplight in a shameful place<br />
  Full of wild revel and unchecked offence,<br />
  And in the midst, one fresh scarce-sullied face,<br />
  Within her eyes, a dreadful innocence.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A quire of seraphs, chanting row on row,<br />
  With lute and viol and high trumpet notes;<br />
  And, above all, their soft young eyes aglow&mdash;<br />
  Child angels, making laud from full clear throats.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Some, on a cliff at dawn, in agony;<br />
  Below, a scaly horror on the sea,<br />
  Lashing the leaden surge.  Fast-bound, a maid<br />
  Waits on the verge, alone, but unafraid.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A poisonous, dead, sad sea-marsh, fringed with pines,<br />
  Thin-set with mouldering churches, old as Time;<br />
  Beyond, on high, just touched with wintry rime,<br />
  The long chain of the autumnal Apennines.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A god-like Presence, beautiful as dawn,<br />
  Watching, upon an untrodden summit white,<br />
  The Earth's last day grow full, and fade in night;<br />
  Then, with a sigh, the Presence is withdrawn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A sheer rock-islet, frowning on the sea<br />
  Where no ship sails, nor ever life may be:<br />
  Thousands of leagues around, from pole to pole,<br />
  The unbounded lonely ocean-currents roll.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Young maids who wander on a flower-lit lawn,<br />
  In springtide of their lives as of the year;<br />
  Meanwhile, unnoticed, swift, a thing of fear,<br />
  Across the sun, a deadly shadow drawn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Slow, hopeless, overborne, without a word,<br />
  Two issuing, as if from Paradise;<br />
  Behind them, stern, and with unpitying eyes,<br />
  Their former selves, wielding a two-edged sword.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A weary woman tricked with gold and gem,<br />
  Wearing some strange barbaric diadem,<br />
  Scorn on her lips, and, like a hidden fire,<br />
  Within her eyes cruel unslaked desire.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Two agèd figures, poor, and blurred with tears;<br />
  Their child, a bold proud woman, sweeping by;<br />
  A hard cold face, which pities not nor fears,<br />
  And all contempt and evil in her eye.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Around a harpsichord, a blue-eyed throng<br />
  Of long-dead children, rapt in sounds devout,<br />
  In some old grange, while on that silent song<br />
  The sabbath twilight fades, and stars come out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The end of things created; Dreadful night,<br />
  Advancing swift on sky, and earth, and sea;<br />
  But at the zenith a departing light,<br />
  A soaring countless blessed company.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  THE LESSON OF TIME.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Lead thou me, Spirit of the World, and I<br />
  Will follow where thou leadest, willingly;<br />
  Not with the careless sceptic's idle mood,<br />
  Nor blindly seeking some unreal good;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For I have come, long since to that full day<br />
  Whose morning mists have fled and curled away&mdash;<br />
  That breathless afternoon-tide when the Sun<br />
  Halts, as it were, before his journey done.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Calm as a river broadening through the plain,<br />
  Which never plunges down the rocks again,<br />
  But, clearly mirrored in its tranquil deep,<br />
  Holds tower and spire and forest as in sleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How old and worn the metaphor appears,<br />
  Old as the tale of passing hopes and fears!<br />
  New as the springtide air, which day by day<br />
  Breathes on young lives, and speeds them on their way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The Roman knew it, and the Hellene too;<br />
  Assyrian and Egyptian proved it true;<br />
  Who found for youth's young glory and its glow<br />
  Serener life, and calmer tides run slow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And them oblivion takes, and those before,<br />
  Whose very name and race we know no more,<br />
  To whom, oh Spirit of the World and Man,<br />
  Thou didst reveal Thyself when Time began,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They felt, as I, what none may understand;<br />
  They touched through darkness on a hidden hand;<br />
  They marked their hopes, their faiths, their longings fade,<br />
  And found a solitude themselves had made;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They came, as I, to hope which conquers doubt,<br />
  Though sun and moon and every star go out;<br />
  They ceased, while at their side a still voice said,<br />
  "Fear not, have courage; blessed are the dead."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They were my brothers&mdash;of one blood with me,<br />
  As with the unborn myriads who shall be:<br />
  I am content to rise and fall as they;<br />
  I watch the rising of the Perfect Day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lead thou me, Spirit, willing and content<br />
  To be, as thou wouldst have me, wholly spent.<br />
  I am thine own, I neither strive nor cry:<br />
  Stretch forth thy hand, I follow, silently.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  VENDREDI SAINT.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  This is Paris, the beautiful city,<br />
  Heaven's gate to the rich, to the poor without pity.<br />
  The clear sun shines on the fair town's graces,<br />
  And on the cold green of the shrunken river,<br />
  And the chill East blows, as 'twould blow for ever,<br />
  On the holiday groups with their shining faces.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For this is the one solemn day of the season,<br />
  When all the swift march of her gay unreason<br />
  Pauses a while, and a thin mask of sadness<br />
  Is spread o'er the features of riot and madness,<br />
  And the churches are crowded with devotees holy,<br />
  Rich and poor, saint and sinner, the great and the lowly.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="letter-spacing: 3em">******</span><br />
</p>


<p class="poem">
  Here is a roofless palace, where gape<br />
  Casements in rows without form or shape:<br />
  A sordid ruin, whose swift decay<br />
  Speaks of that terrible morning in May<br />
  When the whole fair city was blood and fire,<br />
  And the black smoke of ruin rose higher and higher,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And through the still streets, 'neath the broad Spring sun,<br />
  Everywhere murder and rapine were done;<br />
  Women lurking, with torch in hand,<br />
  Evil eyed, sullen, who soon should stand<br />
  Before the sharp bayonets, dripping with blood,<br />
  And be pierced through and through, or shot dead where they stood.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="letter-spacing: 3em">******</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This is the brand-new Hôtel de Ville,<br />
  Where six hundred wretches met death in the fire;<br />
  Ringed round with a pitiless hedge of steel,<br />
  Not one might escape that swift vengeance.  To-day<br />
  The ruin, the carnage, are clean swept away;<br />
  And the sumptuous façades, and the high roofs aspire,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And, upon the broad square, the white palace face<br />
  Looks down with a placid and meaningless grace,<br />
  Ignoring the bloodshed, the struggle, the sorrow,<br />
  The doom that has been, and that may be to-morrow,<br />
  The hidden hatred, the mad endeavour,<br />
  The strife that has been and shall be for ever.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="letter-spacing: 3em">******</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Here rise the twin-towers of Notre Dame,<br />
  Through siege, and revolt, and ruin the same.<br />
  See the people in crowds pressing onward, slowly,<br />
  Along the dark aisles to the altar holy&mdash;<br />
  The altar, to-day, wrapt in mourning and gloom,<br />
  Since He whom they worship lies dead in the tomb.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There, by a tiny acolyte tended,<br />
  A round-cheeked child in his cassock white,<br />
  Lies the tortured figure to which are bended<br />
  The knees of the passers who gaze on the sight,<br />
  And the people fall prostrate, and kiss and mourn<br />
  The fair dead limbs which the nails have torn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And the passionate music comes from the quire,<br />
  Full of soft chords of a yearning pity<br />
  The mournful voices accordant aspire<br />
  To the far-off gates of the Heavenly City;<br />
  And the soft clear alto, soaring high and higher,<br />
  Mounts now a surging fountain, now a heavenward fire.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ay, eighteen centuries after the day,<br />
  A world-worn populace kneel and pray,<br />
  As they pass by and gaze on the limbs unbroken.<br />
  What symbol is this? of what yearnings the token?<br />
  What spell this that leads men a part to be<br />
  Of this old Judæan death-agony?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And I asked, Was it nought but a Nature Divine,<br />
  That for lower Natures consented to die?<br />
  Could a greater than human sacrifice,<br />
  Still make the tears spring to the world-worn eye?<br />
  One thought only it was that replied, and no other:<br />
  This man was our brother.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="letter-spacing: 3em">******</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As I pass from the church, in the cold East wind,<br />
  All its solemn teachings are left behind:<br />
  Here, once again, by the chill blue river,<br />
  The blighted buds on the branches shiver;<br />
  Here, again, are the holiday groups, with delight<br />
  Gaping in wonder at some new sight<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Tis an open doorway, squalid and low,<br />
  And crowds which ceaselessly come and go.<br />
  Careless enough ere they see the sight<br />
  Which leaves the gay faces pallid and white:<br />
  Something is there which can change their mood,<br />
  And check the holiday flow of the blood.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For the face which they see is the face of Death.<br />
  Strange, such a thing as the ceasing of breath<br />
  Should work such miraculous change as here:<br />
  Turn the thing that we love, to a thing of fear;<br />
  Transform the sordid, the low, the mean,<br />
  To a phantasm, pointing to Depths unseen.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There they lie, the dead, unclaimed and unknown,<br />
  Each on his narrow and sloping stone.<br />
  The chill water drips from each to the ground;<br />
  No other movement is there, nor sound.<br />
  With the look which they wore when they came to die,<br />
  They gaze from blind eyes on the pitiless sky.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No woman to-day, thank Heaven, is here;<br />
  But men, old for the most part, and broken quite,<br />
  Who, finding this sad world a place of fear,<br />
  Have leapt forth hopelessly into the night,<br />
  Bankrupt of faith, without love, unfriended,<br />
  Too tired of the comedy ere 'twas ended.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But here is one younger, whose ashy face<br />
  Bears some faint shadow of former grace.<br />
  What brought him here? was it love's sharp fever?<br />
  Was she worse than dead that he bore to leave her?<br />
  Or was his young life, ere its summer came,<br />
  Burnt by Passion's whirlwinds as by a flame.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Was it Drink or Desire, or the die's sure shame,<br />
  Which led this poor wanderer to deep disgrace?<br />
  Was it hopeless misfortune, unmixed with blame,<br />
  That laid him here dead, in this dreadful place?<br />
  Ah Heaven, of these nineteen long centuries,<br />
  Is the sole fruit this thing with the sightless eyes!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yesterday, passion and struggle and strife,<br />
  Hatreds, it may be, and anger-choked breath;<br />
  Yesterday, fear and the burden of life;<br />
  To-day, the cold ease and the calmness of death:<br />
  And that which strove and sinned and yielded there,<br />
  To-day in what hidden place of God's mysterious air?<br />
</p>

<h3>
  THE NEW CREED.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Yesterday, to a girl I said&mdash;<br />
  "I take no pity for the unworthy dead,<br />
  The wicked, the unjust, the vile who die;<br />
  'Twere better thus that they should rot and lie.<br />
  The sweet, the lovable, the just<br />
  Make holy dust;<br />
  Elsewhere than on the earth<br />
  Shall come their second birth.<br />
  Until they go each to his destined place,<br />
  Whether it be to bliss or to disgrace,<br />
  'Tis well that both shall rest, and for a while be dead."<br />
  "There is nowhere else," she said.<br />
  "There is nowhere else."  And this was a girl's voice,<br />
  Who, some short tale of summers gone to-day,<br />
  Would carelessly rejoice,<br />
  As life's blithe springtide passed upon its way<br />
  And all youth's infinite hope and bloom<br />
  Shone round her; nor might any shadow of gloom<br />
  Fall on her as she passed from flower to flower;<br />
  Love sought her, with full dower<br />
  Of happy wedlock and young lives to rear;<br />
  Nor shed her eyes a tear,<br />
  Save for some passing pity, fancy bred.<br />
  All good things were around her&mdash;riches, love,<br />
  All that the heart and mind can move,<br />
  The precious things of art, the undefiled<br />
  And innocent affection of a child.<br />
  Oh girl, who amid sunny ways dost tread,<br />
  What curse is this that blights that comely head?<br />
  For right or wrong there is no further place than here,<br />
  No sanctities of hope, no chastening fear?<br />
  "There is nowhere else," she said.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There is nowhere else," and in the wintry ground<br />
  When we have laid the darlings of our love&mdash;<br />
  The little lad with eyes of blue,<br />
  The little maid with curls of gold,<br />
  Or the beloved aged face<br />
  On which each passing year stamps a diviner grace&mdash;<br />
  That is the end of all, the narrow bound.<br />
  Why look our eyes above<br />
  To an unreal home which mortal never knew&mdash;<br />
  Fold the hands on the breast, the clay-cold fingers fold?<br />
  No waking comes there to the uncaring dead!<br />
  "There is nowhere else," she said.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Strange; is it old or new, this deep distress?<br />
  Or do the generations, as they press<br />
  Onward for ever, onward still,<br />
  Finding no truth to fill<br />
  Their starving yearning souls, from year to year<br />
  Feign some new form of fear<br />
  To fright them, some new terror<br />
  Couched on the path of error,<br />
  Some cold and desolate word which, like a blow,<br />
  Forbids the current of their faith to flow,<br />
  Makes slow their pulse's eager beat,<br />
  And, chilling all their wonted heat,<br />
  Leaves them to darkling thoughts and dreads a prey,<br />
  Uncheered by dawning shaft or setting ray?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah, old it is, indeed, and nowise new.<br />
  This is the poison-growth that grew<br />
  In the old thinkers' fancy-haunted ground.<br />
  They, blinded by some keen too-vivid gleam<br />
  Of the Unseen, to which all things did seem<br />
  To shape themselves and tend,<br />
  Solved, by some Giant Force, the Mystery of Things,<br />
  And, soaring all too high on Fancy's wings,<br />
  Saw in dead matter both their Source and End.<br />
  They felt the self-same shock and pain<br />
  As I who hear these prattlings cold to-day.<br />
  Not otherwise of old the fool to his heart did say.<br />
  "There is no other place of joy or grief,<br />
  Nor wrong in doubt, nor merit in belief:<br />
  There is no God, nor Lord of quick and dead;<br />
  There is nowhere else," they said.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And, indeed, if any to whom life's path were rough<br />
  Should say as you, he had cause maybe at sight.<br />
  For lo, the way is steep and hard enough,<br />
  And wrong is tangled and confused with right;<br />
  And from all the world there goes a solemn sound<br />
  Of lamentations, rising from the ground,<br />
  Confused as that which shocks the wondering ear<br />
  Of one who, gliding on the still lagune,<br />
  Finds the oar's liquid plash and tune<br />
  Broken by wild cries of frenzy and of fear,<br />
  And knows the Isle of Madness drawing near;<br />
  And the scheme of things, if scheme there be indeed,<br />
  Is a book deeper than our eyes may read,<br />
  Full of wild paradox, and vain endeavour,<br />
  And hopes and faiths which find completion never.<br />
  For such a one, in seasons of dismay<br />
  And deep depression and despair,<br />
  Clouds come ofttimes to veil the face of day,<br />
  And there is no ray left of all the beams of gold,<br />
  The glow, the radiance bright, the unclouded faith of old.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But you, poor child forlorn,<br />
  Ah! better were it you were never born;<br />
  Better that you had thrown your life away<br />
  On some coarse lump of clay;<br />
  Better defeat, disgrace, childlessness, all<br />
  That can a solitary life befall,<br />
  Than to have all things and yet be<br />
  Self-bound to dark despondency,<br />
  And self-tormented, beyond reach of doubt,<br />
  By some cold word that puts all yearnings out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There is nowhere else," she said:<br />
  This is the outcome of their crude Belief<br />
  Who are, beyond all rescue and relief,<br />
  Being self-slain and numbered with the dead.<br />
  "There is no God but Force,<br />
  Which, working always on its destined course,<br />
  Speeds on its way and knows no thought of change.<br />
  Within the germ the molecule fares free,<br />
  Holding the potency of what shall be;<br />
  Within the little germ lurks the heaven-reaching tree:<br />
  No break is there in all the cosmic show.<br />
  What place is there, in all the Scheme Immense,<br />
  For a remote unworking Excellence<br />
  Which may not be perceived by any sense,<br />
  Which makes no humble blade of grass to grow,<br />
  Which adds no single link to things and thoughts we know?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "For everything that is, indeed,<br />
  Bears with it its own seed;<br />
  It cannot change or cease and be no more:<br />
  For ever all things are even as they were before<br />
  Or if, by long degrees and slow,<br />
  More complex doth the organism grow,<br />
  It makes no break in the eternal plan;<br />
  There is no gulf that yawns between the herb and man."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Poor child, what is it they have taught,<br />
  Who through deep glooms and desert wastes of thought<br />
  Have brought to such as you their dreary creed?<br />
  Have they no care, indeed,<br />
  For all the glorious gains of man's long past,<br />
  For all our higher hope of what shall be at last?<br />
  "All things are moulded in one mould;<br />
  They spring, they are, they fade by one compulsion cold&mdash;<br />
  Some dark necessity we cannot know,<br />
  Which bids them wax and grow,&mdash;<br />
  That is sufficient cause for all things, quick and dead!"<br />
  "There is no Cause else," she said.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Oh, poor indeed, and in evil case,<br />
  Who shouldst be far from sound of doubt<br />
  As a maiden in some restful place<br />
  Whose busy life, year in year out,<br />
  Is made of gentle worship, homely days<br />
  Marked by their growing sum of prayer and praise,<br />
  The church spire pointing to the longed-for sky,<br />
  The heaven that opens to the cloistered eye.<br />
  For us, for us, who mid the weary strife<br />
  And jangling discords of our life<br />
  Are day by day opprest,<br />
  'Twere little wonder were our souls distrest,<br />
  God, and the life to be, and all our early trust<br />
  Being far from us expelled and thrust;<br />
  But for you, child, who cannot know at all<br />
  To what hidden laws we stand or fall,<br />
  To what bad heights the wrong within may grow,<br />
  To what dark deeps the stream of hopeless lives may flow!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For let the doubter babble as he can,<br />
  There is no wit in man<br />
  Which can make Force rise higher still<br />
  Up to the heights of Will,&mdash;<br />
  No phase of Force which finite minds can know<br />
  Can self-determined grow,<br />
  And of itself elect what shall its essence be:<br />
  The same to all eternity,<br />
  Unchanged, unshaped, it goes upon its blinded way;<br />
  Nor can all forces nor all laws<br />
  Bring ceasing to the scheme, nor any pause,<br />
  Nor shape it to the mould in which to be&mdash;<br />
  Form from the wingèd seed the myriad-branching tree,&mdash;<br />
  Nor guide the force once sped, so that it turn<br />
  To Water-floods that quench or Fires that burn,<br />
  Or now to the electric current change,<br />
  Or draw all things by some attraction strange.<br />
  Or in the brain of man, working unseen, sublime,<br />
  Transcend the narrow bounds of Space and Time.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Whence comes the innate Power which knows to guide<br />
  The force deflected so from side to side,<br />
  That not a barren line from whence to where<br />
  It goes upon its way through the unfettered air?<br />
  What sways the prisoned atom on its fruitful course?<br />
  Ah, it was more than Force<br />
  Which gave the Universe of things its form and face!<br />
  Force moving on its path through Time and Space<br />
  Would nought enclose, but leave all barren still<br />
  A higher Power, it was, the worlds could form and fill;<br />
  And by some pre-existent harmony<br />
  Were all things made as Fate would have them be&mdash;<br />
  Fate, the ineffable Word of an Eternal Will.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All things that are or seem,<br />
  Whether we wake who see or do but dream,<br />
  Are of that Primal Will phantasms, if no more;<br />
  He who sees these sees God, and seeing doth adore.<br />
  Joy, suffering, evil, good,<br />
  Whatever our daily food,<br />
  Whate'er the mystery and paradox of things,<br />
  Low creeping thoughts and high imaginings.<br />
  The laughters of the world, the age-long groan,<br />
  Bring to his mind one name, one thought alone;<br />
  All beauty, right, deformity, or wrong,<br />
  Sing to his ear one high unchanging song;<br />
  And everything that is, to his rapt fancy brings<br />
  The hidden beat through space of the Eternal Wings.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Where did the Idea dwell,<br />
  At first, which was of all the germ and seed?<br />
  Which worked from Discord order, from blind Force<br />
  Sped all the Cosmos on its upward course?<br />
  Which held within the atom and the cell<br />
  The whole vast hidden Universe, sheltered well,<br />
  Till the hour came to unfold it, and the need?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What did the ever-upward growth conceive,<br />
  Which from the obedient monad formed the herb, the tree,<br />
  The animal, the man, the high growths that shall be?<br />
  Ever from simpler to more complex grown,<br />
  The long processions from a source unknown<br />
  Unfold themselves across the scene of life.<br />
  Oh blessed struggle and strife,<br />
  Fare onward to the end, since from a Source<br />
  Thou art, which doth transcend and doth determine Force!<br />
  Fare onward to the end; not from Force, dead and blind,<br />
  Thou comest, but from the depths of the Creative Mind.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fare on to the end, but how should ending be,<br />
  If Will be in the Universe, and plan?<br />
  Some higher thing shall be, that which to-day is Man.<br />
  Undying is each cosmic force:<br />
  Undying, but transformed, it runs its endless course;<br />
  It cannot wane, or sink, or be no more.<br />
  Not even the dust and lime which clothe us round<br />
  Lose their own substance in the charnel-ground,<br />
  Or carried far upon the weltering wind;<br />
  Only with other growths combined,<br />
  In some new whole they are for ever&mdash;<br />
  They are, and perish never.<br />
  The great suns shed themselves in heat and light<br />
  Upon the unfilled interstellar air,<br />
  Till all their scattered elements unite<br />
  And are replenished as before they were.<br />
  Nothing is lost, nor can be: change alone,<br />
  Unceasing, never done,<br />
  Shapes all the forms of things, and keeps them still<br />
  Obedient to the Unknown Perfect Will.<br />
  And shall the life that is the highest that we know,<br />
  Shall this, alone, no more increase, expand and grow?<br />

<p class="poem">
  Nay, somewhere else there is, although we know not where,<br />

  Content, through all eternity,<br />

  Content to be at rest;<br />
  Content to work and fare through endless days;<br />
  Content to spend ourselves in endless praise:<br />
  Nay, if it be the Will Divine,<br />
  Content to be, and through long lives to pine,<br />
  Far from the light which vivifies, the fire<br />
  Which breathes upon our being and doth inspire<br />
  All soaring thoughts and hopes which light our pathway here;<br />
  Content, though with some natural thrill of fear,<br />
  To be purged through by age-long pain,<br />
  Till we resume our upward march again;<br />
  Content, if need, to take some lower form,<br />
  Some humbler herb or worm<br />
  To be awhile, if e'er the eternal plan<br />
  Go back from higher to lower, from man to less than man.<br />
  Not so, indeed, we hold, but rather this&mdash;<br />
  That all Time gone, that all that was or is,<br />
  The scarpèd cliff, the illimitable Past,<br />
  This truth alone of all truths else hold fast:&mdash;<br />
  From lower to higher, from simple to complete,<br />
  This is the pathway of the Eternal Feet;<br />
  From earth to lichen, herb to flowering tree,<br />
  From cell to creeping worm, from man to what shall be.<br />
  This is the solemn lesson of all time,<br />
  This is the teaching of the voice sublime:<br />
  Eternal are the worlds, and all that them do fill;<br />
  Eternal is the march of the Creative Will;<br />
  Eternal is the life of man, and sun, and star;<br />
  Ay, even though they fade a while, they are;<br />
  And though they pause from shining, speed for ever still.<br />

  A GREAT GULF.

<p class="poem">
  If any tender sire<br />
  Who sits girt round by loving faces<br />
  And happy childhood's thousand graces,<br />
  Through sudden crash or fire<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Should 'scape from this poor life to some mysterious air,<br />

  Should through his overmastering pain<br />
  Break through the awful bounds the Eternal sets between<br />

  And having gained once more<br />
  The confines of the Earth, the scarce-left place<br />
  Which greets him with unchanged familiar face&mdash;<br />
  The well-remembered door,<br />
  The rose he watered blooming yet,<br />
  Nought to remember or forget,<br />
  No change in all the world except in him,<br />
  Nor there save in some sense, already dim<br />
  Before the unchanged past, so that he seem<br />
  A mortal spirit still, and what was since, a dream;<br />

<p class="poem">
  And in the well-known room<br />

  Finds his voice mute, his form unknown, unseen,<br />
  And thinks with irrepressible pain<br />

  And feels his new life's inmost chambers stirred<br />
  If only of his own, he might be seen or heard;<br />

<p class="poem">
  Then if, at length,<br />
  The father's yearning and overburdened soul<br />
  Burst into shape and voice which scorn control<br />
  Of its despairing strength,&mdash;<br />
  Ah Heaven! ah pity for the present dread<br />
  Which strikes the old affection, dull and dead!<br />
  Ah, better were it far than this thing to remain,<br />
  Voiceless, unseen, unloved, for ever and in pain!<br />

<p class="poem">
  So when a finer mind,<br />
  Knowing its old self swept by some weird change<br />
  And the old thought deceased, or else grown strange,<br />
  Turns to those left behind,<br />
  With passionate stress and mighty yearning stirred,&mdash;<br />
  It strives to stand revealed in shape and word<br />
  In vain; or by strong travail visible grown,<br />
  Finds but a world estranged, and lives and dies alone!<br />

<p class="poem">

<p class="poem">
  Ah me, ah me! on this high mountain peak,<br />
  Which far above the seething Lydian plains<br />
  Takes the first dawn-shaft, and the sunset keeps<br />
  When all the fields grow dark&mdash;I, Niobe,<br />
  A mother's heart, hid in a form of stone,<br />
  Stand all day in the vengeful sun-god's eye,<br />
  Stand all night in the cold gaze of the moon,<br />
  Who both long ages since conspiring, slew<br />
  My children,&mdash;I a childless mother now<br />
  Who was most blest, a living woman still,<br />
  Bereft of all, and yet who cannot die.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah day, ill-fated day, which wrecked my life!<br />
  I was the happy mother of strong sons,<br />
  Brave, beautiful, all in their bloom of age:<br />
  From him my first-born, now a bearded man,<br />
  Through the fair promise of imperfect youth,<br />
  To the slim stripling who had scarcely left<br />
  The women's chambers, on whose lip scant shade<br />
  Of budding manhood showed, I loved them all;<br />
  All with their father's eyes, and that strange charm<br />
  Of rhythmic grace, and musical utterance<br />
  As when, in far-off Thebes, the enchanted wall<br />
  Rose perfect, to the music of his lyre.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah me, the fatal day!  For at high noon<br />
  I sate within my Theban palace fair&mdash;<br />
  Deep summer-time it was&mdash;and marked the crowd<br />
  From the thronged city street, to the smooth plain,<br />
  Stream joyously: the brave youths, full of life,<br />
  Stripped for the mimic fray, the leap, the race,<br />
  The wrestling; and the princes, my strong sons,<br />
  The fair limbs I had borne beneath my zone<br />
  Grown to full stature, such as maidens love,&mdash;<br />
  The sinewy arms, the broad chests, and strong loins<br />
  Of manhood; the imperfect flower-like forms,<br />
  Eager with youth's first fires; my youngest born,<br />
  My darling, doffing his ephebic robe<br />
  Which late he donned with pride, a child in heart,<br />
  In budding limbs a youth;&mdash;I see them go<br />
  Their fair young bodies glistening in the sun,<br />
  Which kissed the shining olive.  As they went,<br />
  The joyous concourse winding towards the plain,<br />
  My happy eyes o'erflowed, and as I turned<br />
  And saw my daughters round me, fair grown lives<br />
  And virgin, sitting spinning the white flax,<br />
  Each with her distaff, beautiful and fit<br />
  To wed with any stately king of men<br />
  And reign a queen in Hellas, my glad heart<br />
  Broke forth in pride, and as I looked I thought,<br />
  "Oh happy, happy mother of such sons!<br />
  Oh happy, happy mother of such girls!<br />
  For whom full soon the joyous nuptial rites<br />
  Shall bring the expectant bridegroom and the bride,<br />
  And soon once more the little childish hands<br />
  Which shall renew my early wedded years,<br />
  When the king loved me first.  Thrice blest indeed.<br />
  There is no queen in Hellas such as I,<br />
  Dowered with such fair-grown offspring; not a queen<br />
  Nor mother o'er all earth's plain, around which flows<br />
  The wide salt stream of the surrounding sea,<br />
  As blest as I am.  Nay, in Olympus' self<br />
  What offspring were they to all-ruling Zeus<br />
  That Leto bore?  Phoebus and Artemis,<br />
  A goodly pair indeed, but two alone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Poor mother, that to such a lord as Zeus<br />
  Bare only those, no fairer than my own.<br />
  Nay, I am happier than a goddess' self;<br />
  I would not give this goodly train of mine<br />
  For that scant birth.  I ask no boon of Zeus,<br />
  Nor of the Olympian Gods; for I am glad<br />
  No fruitful mother in a peasant's hut,<br />
  Scorning the childless great, thinks scorn of me,<br />
  Being such as I.  Nay, let Queen Leto's self<br />
  Know, that a mortal queen has chanced to bear<br />
  As fair as she, and more."<br />

  While the unholy pride flashed through my soul,<br />
  There pierced through the closed lattice one keen shaft<br />
  Of blinding sun, which on the opposite wall<br />
  Traced some mysterious sign, and on my mind<br />
  Such vague remorse and consciousness of ill,<br />
  That straightway all my pride was sunk and lost<br />
  In a great dread, nor could I longer bear<br />
  To look upon the fairness of my girls,<br />
  Who, seeing the vague trouble in my eyes,<br />
  Grew pale, and shuddered for no cause, and gazed<br />
  Chilled 'midst the blaze of sunlight.<br />

  To laugh my fears away, as one who feels<br />
  Some great transgression weigh on him, some load<br />
  Which will not be removed, but bears him down,<br />
  Though none else knows it, pressing on his heart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But when the half unuttered thought grew dim<br />
  And my fear with it, suddenly a cry<br />
  Rose from the city street, and then the sound<br />
  Of measured hurrying feet, and looking forth<br />
  To where the youth had passed so late, in joy,<br />
  Came two who carried tenderly, with tears,<br />
  A boy's slight form.  I had no need to look,<br />
  For all the mother rising in me knew<br />
  That 'twas my youngest born they bore; I knew<br />
  What fate befell him&mdash;'twas the vengeful sun,<br />
  And I alone was guilty, I, his mother,<br />
  Who being filled with impious pride, had brought<br />
  Death to my innocent child.  I hurried down<br />
  The marble stair and met them as they came,<br />
  And laid him down, and kissed his lips and called<br />
  His name, yet knew that he was dead; and all<br />
  His brothers stood regarding us with tears,<br />
  And would have soothed me with their loving words,<br />
  Me guilty, who were guiltless, oh, my sons!<br />
  Till as I looked up from the corpse,&mdash;a cry<br />
  Of agony,&mdash;and then another fell<br />
  Struggling for life upon the earth, and then<br />
  Another, and another, till the last<br />
  Of all my stalwart boys, my life, my pride,<br />
  Lay dead upon the field, and the fierce sun<br />
  Frenzied my brain, and all distraught with woe<br />
  I to the palace tottered, while they bore<br />
  Slowly the comely corpses of my sons.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That day I dare not think of where they lay,<br />
  White shrouded, in the darkened palace rooms,<br />
  Like sculptured statues on a marble hearse.<br />
  How calm they looked and happy, my dear sons!<br />
  There was no look of pain within their eyes,<br />
  The dear dead eyes which I their mother closed;<br />
  Me miserable!  I saw the priests approach,<br />
  And ministers of death; I saw my girls<br />
  Flung weeping on the brothers whom they loved.<br />
  I saw it all as in a dream.  I know not<br />
  How often the dead night woke into day,<br />
  How often the hot day-time turned to night.<br />
  I did not shudder even to see the Sun<br />
  Which slew my sons; but in the still, dead night,<br />
  When in that chill and lifeless place of death,<br />
  The cold, clear, cruel moonlight seemed to play<br />
  Upon the rangéd corpses, and to mock<br />
  My mother's heart, and throw on each a hue<br />
  Of swift corruption ere its time, I knew<br />
  Some secret terror lest the jealous gods<br />
  Might find some further dreadful vengeance still,<br />
  Taking what yet was left.<br />

  The sad procession to the place of graves<br />
  Went with the rites of royal sepulchre,<br />
  The high priest at its head, the nobles round<br />
  The fair white shrouded corpses, last of all<br />
  I went, the guilty one, my fair sweet girls<br />
  Clinging to me in tears; but I, I shed not<br />
  A single tear&mdash;grief dried the fount of tears,<br />
  I had shed all mine.<br />

  Oh, wretched me, my dear, my well-loved sons!<br />
  Within the royal sepulchre, the sun<br />
  Had set, and in his stead the rising moon,<br />
  Behind some lofty mountain-peak concealed,<br />
  Filled all with ghastly twilight.  As we knelt,<br />
  The people all withdrawn a little space,<br />
  I and my daughters in that place of death,<br />
  I lifted up my suppliant voice, and they<br />
  With sweet girl voices pure, and soaring hymn,<br />
  To the great Powers above.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when at last<br />
  I heard my hollow voice pleading alone<br />
  And all the others silent, then I looked,<br />
  And on the tomb the cold malignant moon,<br />
  Bursting with pale chill beams of light, revealed<br />
  My fair girls kneeling mute and motionless,<br />
  Their dead eyes turned to the unpitying orb,<br />
  Their white lips which should offer prayer no more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Such vengeance wreaked Phoebus and Artemis<br />
  Upon a too proud mother.  But on me<br />
  Who only sinned no other punishment<br />
  They took, only the innocent lives I loved&mdash;<br />
  If any punishment, indeed, were more<br />
  Than this to one who had welcomed death.  I think<br />
  My children happier far in death than I<br />
  Who live to muse on these things.  When my girls<br />
  Were buried, I, my lonely palace gate<br />
  Leaving without a tear, sped hither in haste<br />
  To this high rock of Sipylus where erst<br />
  My father held his court; and here, long years,<br />
  Summer and winter, stay I, day and night<br />
  Gazing towards the far-off plain of Thebes,<br />
  Wherein I was so happy of old time,<br />
  Wherein I sinned and suffered.  Turned to stone<br />
  They thought me, and 'tis true the mother's heart<br />
  Which knows such grief as I knew, turns to stone,<br />
  And all her life; and pitying Zeus, indeed,<br />
  Seeing my repentance, listened to my prayer<br />
  And left me seeming stone, but still the heart<br />
  Of the mother grows not hard, and year by year<br />
  When comes the summer with its cloudless skies,<br />
  And the high sun lights hill and plain by day,<br />
  And the moon, shining, silvers them by night,<br />
  My old grief, rising dew-like to my eyes,<br />
  Quickens my life with not unhappy tears,<br />
  And through my penitent and yearning heart<br />
  I feel once more the pulse of love and grief:<br />
  Love triumphing at last o'er Fate and Death,<br />
  Grief all divine and vindicating Love.<br />

  Only to crow and smile, as yet<br />

  When the young Alexander's conquering star<br />
  Flamed on the wondering world, being indeed<br />
  The comrade of his arms, from the far East<br />
  Brought back this story of requited love.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A Prince there was of Media, next of blood<br />
  To the great King Hystaspes, fair of form<br />
  As brave of soul, who to his flower of age<br />
  Was come, but never yet had known the dart<br />
  Of Cypris, being but a soldier bold,<br />
  Too much by trenchèd camps and wars' alarms<br />
  Engrossed, to leave a thought for things of love.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now, at this selfsame time, by Tanais<br />
  Omartes ruled, a just and puissant king.<br />
  No son was his, only one daughter fair,<br />
  Odatis, of whose beauty and whose worth<br />
  Fame filled the furthest East.  Only as yet,<br />
  Of all the suitors for her hand, came none<br />
  Who touched her maiden heart; but, fancy free,<br />
  She dwelt unwedded, lonely as a star.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Till one fair night in springtide, when the heart<br />
  Blossoms as does the earth, Cypris, the Queen,<br />
  Seeing that love is sweet for all to taste,<br />
  And pitying these loveless parted lives,<br />
  Deep in the sacred silence of the night,<br />
  From out the ivory gate sent down on them<br />
  A happy dream, so that the Prince had sight<br />
  Of fair Odatis in her diadem<br />
  And habit as she lived, and saw the charm<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And treasure of her eyes, and knew her name<br />
  And country as it was; while to the maid<br />
  There came a like fair vision of the Prince<br />
  Leading to fight the embattled Median hosts,<br />
  Young, comely, brave, clad in his panoply<br />
  And pride of war, so strong, so fair, so true,<br />
  That straight, the virgin coldness of her soul<br />
  Melted beneath the vision, as the snow<br />
  In springtime at the kisses of the sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And when they twain awoke to common day<br />
  From that blest dream, still on their trancèd eyes<br />
  The selfsame vision lingered.  He a form<br />
  Lovelier than all his life had known, more pure<br />
  And precious than all words; she a strong soul<br />
  Yet tender, comely with the fire, the force<br />
  Of youthful manhood; saw both night and day<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nor ever from their mutual hearts the form<br />
  Of that celestial vision waned nor grew<br />
  Faint with the daily stress of common life,<br />
  As do our mortal phantasies, but still<br />
  He, while the fiery legions clashed and broke,<br />
  Saw one sweet face above the flash of spears;<br />
  She in high palace pomps, or household tasks,<br />
  Or 'mid the glittering courtier-crowded halls<br />
  Saw one brave ardent gaze, one manly form.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now while in dreams of love these lovers lived<br />
  Who never met in waking hours, who knew not<br />
  Whether with unrequited love they burned, or whether<br />
  In mutual yearnings blest; the King Omartes,<br />
  Grown anxious for his only girl, and knowing<br />
  How blest it is to love, would bid her choose<br />
  Whom she would wed, and summoning the maid,<br />
  With fatherly counsels pressed on her; but she:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Father, I am but young; I pray you, ask not<br />
  That I should wed; nay, rather let me live<br />
  My life within your house.  I cannot wed.<br />
  I can love only one, who is the Prince<br />
  Of Media, but I know not if indeed<br />
  His love is his to give, or if he know<br />
  My love for him; only a heavenly vision,<br />
  Sent in the sacred silence of the night,<br />
  Revealed him to me as I know he is.<br />
  Wherefore, my father, though thy will be law,<br />
  Have pity on me; let me love my love,<br />
  If not with recompense of love, alone;<br />
  For I can love none else."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the King said:<br />
  "Daughter, to me thy happiness is life,<br />
  And more; but now, I pray thee, let my words<br />
  Sink deep within thy mind.  Thou canst not know<br />
  If this strange vision through the gate of truth<br />
  Came or the gate of error.  Oftentimes<br />
  The gods send strong delusions to ensnare<br />
  Too credulous hearts.  Thou canst not know, in sooth,<br />
  If 'twas the Prince thou saw'st, or, were it he,<br />
  If love be his to give; and if it were,<br />
  I could not bear to lose thee, for indeed<br />
  I have no son to take my place, or pour<br />
  Libations on my tomb, and shouldst thou wed<br />
  A stranger, and be exiled from thy home,<br />
  What were my life to me?  Nay, daughter, dream<br />
  No more, but with some chieftain of my realm<br />
  Prepare thyself to wed.  With the new moon<br />
  A solemn banquet will I make, and bid<br />
  Whatever of high descent and generous youth<br />
  Our country holds.  There shalt thou make thy choice<br />
  Of whom thou wilt, nor will I seek to bind<br />
  Thy unfettered will; only I fain would see thee<br />
  In happy wedlock bound, and feel the touch<br />
  Of childish hands again, and soothe my age<br />
  With sight of thy fair offspring round my knees."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then she, because she loved her sire and fain<br />
  Would do his will, left him without a word,<br />
  Obedient to his hest; but day and night<br />
  The one unfading image of her dream<br />
  Filled all her longing sight, and day and night<br />
  The image of her Prince in all the pride<br />
  And bravery of battle shone on her.<br />
  Nor was there any strength in her to heal<br />
  The wound which love had made, by reasonings cold,<br />
  Or musing on the phantasies of love;<br />
  But still the fierce dart of the goddess burned<br />
  Within her soul, as when a stricken deer<br />
  O'er hill and dale escaping bears with her<br />
  The barb within her side; and oft alone<br />
  Within her secret chamber she would name<br />
  The name of him she loved, and oft by night,<br />
  When sleep had bound her fast, her pale lips formed<br />
  The syllables of his name.  Through the long hours,<br />
  Waking or sleeping, were her thoughts on him;<br />
  So that the unfilled yearning long deferred<br />
  Made her heart sick, and like her heart, her form<br />
  Wasted, her fair cheek paled, and from her eyes<br />
  Looked out the silent suffering of her soul<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now, when the day drew near which brought the feast,<br />
  One of her slaves, who loved her, chanced to hear<br />
  Her sweet voice wandering in dreams, and caught<br />
  The Prince's name; and, being full of grief<br />
  And pity for her pain, and fain to aid<br />
  The gentle girl she loved, made haste to send<br />
  A messenger to seek the Prince and tell him<br />
  How he was loved, and when the feast should be,<br />
  And how the King would have his daughter wed.<br />
  But to the Princess would she breathe no word<br />
  Of what was done, till, almost on the eve<br />
  Of the great feast, seeing her wan and pale<br />
  And all unhappy, falling at her knees,<br />
  She, with a prayer for pardon, told her all.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But when the Princess heard her, virgin shame&mdash;<br />
  Love drawing her and Pride of Maidenhood<br />
  In opposite ways till all distraught was she&mdash;<br />
  Flushed her pale cheek, and fired her tearful eyes.<br />
  Yet since she knew that loving thought alone<br />
  Prompted the deed, being soft and pitiful,<br />
  She bade her have no fear, and though at first<br />
  Unwilling, by degrees a newborn hope<br />
  Chased all her shame away, and once again<br />
  A long unwonted rose upon her cheek<br />
  Bloomed, and a light long vanished fired her eyes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Meanwhile upon the plains in glorious war<br />
  The brave Prince led his conquering hosts; but still,<br />
  Amid the shock of battle and the crash<br />
  Of hostile spears, one vision filled his soul<br />
  Amid the changes of the hard-fought day,<br />
  Throughout the weary watches of the night,<br />
  The dream, the happy dream, returned again.<br />
  Always the selfsame vision of a maid<br />
  Fairer than earthly, filled his eyes and took<br />
  The savour from the triumph, ay, and touched<br />
  The warrior's heart with an unwonted ruth,<br />
  So that he shrank as never yet before<br />
  From every day's monotony of blood,<br />
  And saw with unaccustomed pain the sum<br />
  Of death and pain, and hopeless shattered lives,<br />
  Because a softer influence touched his soul.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Till one night, on the day before the feast<br />
  Which King Omartes destined for his peers,<br />
  While now his legions swept their conquering way<br />
  A hundred leagues or more from Tanais,<br />
  There came the message from the slave, and he<br />
  Within his tent, after the well-fought day,<br />
  Resting with that fair image in his eyes,<br />
  Woke suddenly to know that he was loved.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then, in a moment, putting from him sleep<br />
  And well-earned rest, he bade his charioteer<br />
  Yoke to his chariot three unbroken colts<br />
  Which lately o'er the endless Scythian plain<br />
  Careered, untamed; and, through the sleeping camp,<br />
  Beneath the lucid aspect of the night,<br />
  He sped as speeds the wind.  The great stars hung<br />
  Like lamps above the plain; the great stars sank<br />
  And faded in the dawn; the hot red sun<br />
  Leapt from the plain; noon faded into eve;<br />
  Again the same stars lit the lucid night;<br />
  And still, with scarce a pause, those fierce hoofs dashed<br />
  Across the curved plain onward, till he saw<br />
  Far off the well-lit palace casements gleam<br />
  Wherein his love was set.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then instantly<br />
  He checked his panting team, the rapid wheels<br />
  Ceased, and his mail and royal garb he hid<br />
  Beneath a white robe such as nobles use<br />
  By Tanais; and to the lighted hall<br />
  He passed alone, afoot, giving command<br />
  To him who drove, to await him at the gate.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now, when the Prince drew near the vestibule,<br />
  The feast long time had sped, and all the guests<br />
  Had eaten and drunk their fill; and he unseen,<br />
  Through the close throng of serving men and maids<br />
  Around the door, like some belated guest<br />
  To some obscurer station slipped, and took<br />
  The wine-cup with the rest, who marvelled not<br />
  To see him come, nor knew him; only she<br />
  Who sent the message whispered him a word:<br />
  "Have courage; she is there, and cometh soon.<br />
  Be brave; she loves thee only; watch and wait."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Even then the King Omartes, where he sate<br />
  On high among his nobles, gave command<br />
  To summon from her maiden chamber forth<br />
  The Princess.  And obedient to the call,<br />
  Robed in pure white, clothed round with maiden shame,<br />
  Full of vague hope and tender yearning love,<br />
  To the high royal throne Odatis came.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And when the Prince beheld the maid, and saw<br />
  The wonder which so long had filled his soul&mdash;<br />
  His vision of the still night clothed with life<br />
  And breathing earthly air&mdash;and marked the heave<br />
  Of her white breast, and saw the tell-tale flush<br />
  Crimson her cheek with maiden modesty,<br />
  Scarce could his longing eager arms forbear<br />
  To clasp the virgin round, so fair she seemed.<br />
  But, being set far down from where the King<br />
  Sat high upon the daïs 'midst the crowd<br />
  Of eager emulous faces looking love,<br />
  None marked his passionate gaze, or stretched-forth hands;<br />
  Till came a pause, which hushed the deep-drawn sigh<br />
  Of admiration, as the jovial King,<br />
  Full tender of his girl, but flushed with wine,<br />
  Spake thus to her:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daughter, to this high feast<br />
  Are bidden all the nobles of our land.<br />
  Now, therefore, since to wed is good, and life<br />
  To the unwedded woman seems a load<br />
  Which few may bear, and none desire, I prithee,<br />
  This jewelled chalice taking, mingle wine<br />
  As well thou knowest, and the honeyed draught<br />
  Give to some noble youth of those thou seest<br />
  Along the well-ranged tables, knowing well<br />
  That him to whom thou givest, thou shalt wed.<br />
  I fetter not thy choice, girl.  I grow old;<br />
  I have no son to share the weight of rule,<br />
  And fain would see thy children ere I die."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then, with a kiss upon her blushing cheek,<br />
  He gave the maid the cup.  The cressets' light<br />
  Fell on the jewelled chalice, which gave back<br />
  A thousand answering rays.  Silent she stood<br />
  A moment, half in doubt, then down the file<br />
  Of close-ranked eager faces flushed with hope,<br />
  And eyes her beauty kindled more than wine,<br />
  Passed slow, a breathing statue.  Her white robe<br />
  Among the purple and barbaric gold<br />
  Showed like the snowy plumage of a dove,<br />
  As down the hall, the cup within her hands,<br />
  She, now this way regarding and now that,<br />
  Passed, with a burning blush upon her cheek;<br />
  And on each youthful noble her large eyes<br />
  Rested a moment only, icy cold,<br />
  Though many indeed were there, brave, fair to see,<br />
  Fit for a maiden's love; but never at all<br />
  The one overmastering vision of her dream<br />
  Rose on her longing eyes, till hope itself<br />
  Grew faint, and, ere she gained the end, she turned<br />
  Sickening to where, along the opposite wall,<br />
  Sate other nobles young and brave as those,<br />
  But not the fated vision of her dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Meanwhile the Prince, who 'mid the close-set throng<br />
  Of humbler guests was hidden, saw her come<br />
  And turn ere she had marked him, and again<br />
  Down the long line of princely revellers<br />
  Pass slow as in a dream; and all his soul<br />
  Grew sick with dread lest haply, seeing not<br />
  The one expected face, and being meek<br />
  And dutiful, and reverencing her sire,<br />
  She in despair might make some sudden choice<br />
  And leave him without love.  And as she went<br />
  He could not choose but gaze, as oft in sleep<br />
  Some dreadful vision chains us that we fail<br />
  To speak or move, though to be still is death.<br />
  And once he feared that she had looked on him<br />
  And passed, and once he thought he saw her pause<br />
  By some tall comely youth; and then she reached<br />
  The opposite end, and as she turned her face<br />
  And came toward him again and where the jars<br />
  Of sweet wine stood for mingling, with a bound<br />
  His heart went out to her; for now her cheek<br />
  Pale as the white moon sailing through the sky,<br />
  And the dead hope within her eyes, and pain<br />
  And hardly conquered tears, made sure his soul,<br />
  Knowing that she was his.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she, dear heart,<br />
  Being sick indeed with love, and in despair,<br />
  Yet reverencing her duty to her sire,<br />
  Turned half-distraught to fill the fated cup<br />
  And with it mar her life.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as she stood<br />
  Alone within the vestibule and poured<br />
  The sweet wine forth, slow, trembling, blind with tears,<br />
  A voice beside her whispered, "Love, I am here!"<br />
  And looking round her, at her side she saw<br />
  A youthful mailed form&mdash;the festal robe<br />
  Flung backward, and the face, the mouth, the eyes<br />
  Whereof the vision filled her night and day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then straight, without a word, with one deep sigh,<br />
  She held the wine-cup forth.  He poured forth first<br />
  Libation to the goddess, and the rest<br />
  Drained at a draught, and cast his arms round her,<br />
  And down the long-drawn sounding colonnade<br />
  Snatched her to where without, beneath the dawn,<br />
  The brave steeds waited and the charioteer.<br />
  His robe he round her threw; they saw the flare<br />
  Of torches at the gate; they heard the shouts<br />
  Of hot pursuit grow fainter; till at last,<br />
  In solitude, across the rounding plain<br />
  They flew through waking day, until they came<br />
  To Media, and were wed.  And soon her sire,<br />
  Knowing their love, consented, and they lived<br />
  Long happy lives; such is the might of Love.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

<p class="poem">
  That is the tale the soldier from the East,<br />
  Chares of Mytilené, ages gone,<br />
  Told oftentimes at many a joyous feast<br />
  In Hellas; and he said that all the folk<br />

  The story in the temples of their gods,<br />

<h3>
  SUFFRAGES.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "Surely," said a voice, "O Lord, Thy judgments<br />
  Are dreadful and hard to understand.<br />
  Thy laws which Thou madest, they withstand Thee,<br />
  They stand against Thee and Thy command:<br />
  Thy poor, they are with us evermore;<br />
  They suffer terrible things and sore;<br />
  They are starved, they are sick, they die,<br />
  And there is none to help or heed;<br />
  They come with a great and bitter cry<br />
  They hardly dare to whisper, as they plead;<br />
  And there is none to hear them, God or man;<br />
  And it is little indeed that all our pity can."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What, and shall I be moved to tears,<br />
  As I sit in this still chamber here alone,<br />
  By the pity of it,&mdash;the childish lives that groan,<br />
  The miseries and the sorrows, the hopes and the fears<br />
  Of this wonderful legend of life, that is one and the same<br />
  Though it differ in weal and in happiness, honour and fame,&mdash;<br />
  Shall I turn, who am no more than a worm, to Thee,<br />
  From the pity of it&mdash;the want, the misery,<br />
  And with strong yearnings beat, and rebellions wild,<br />
  Seeing death written, and pain, in the face of a child;&mdash;<br />
  And yet art Thou unmoved!<br />
  Ah, Lord, if Thou sawest surely!&mdash;and yet Thou dost see;<br />
  And if Thou knewest indeed!&mdash;and yet all things are clear to Thee.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For, Lord, of a truth Thy great ones,<br />
  Who have not their wealth of their own desert,<br />
  Live ever equal lives and sure,<br />
  And are never vexed nor suffer hurt,<br />
  But through long untroubled years endure<br />
  Until they join Thee, and are in bliss;<br />
  Or, maybe, are carried away from Thee, and miss<br />
  Thy Face, which is too pure for them to see,<br />
  And are thenceforth in misery:<br />
  But, nevertheless, upon the earth<br />
  They come to neither sorrow nor dearth.<br />
  They are great, and they live out their lives, and Thou lettest them be;<br />
  Thou dost not punish them here, if they despise<br />
  Thy poor and pass them by with averted eyes.<br />
  They are strong and mighty, and never in danger to fall;<br />
  But Thou, Lord, art mighty and canst, and yet carest not at all.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But wherefore is it that such things are;&mdash;<br />
  That want and famine, and blood and war<br />
  Are everywhere, and do prevail?<br />
  And wherefore is it the same monotonous tale<br />
  Is ever told by the lips of men?<br />
  For there is hardly so hard a heart<br />
  In the breast of a man who has taken his part<br />
  In the world, and has little children around his knees,<br />
  But is filled with great love for them as Thou art for these,<br />
  And would give his life for their good, and is filled day and night<br />
  With fatherly thoughts of fear and yearning for right,<br />
  And grows sick, if evil come nigh them body or soul,<br />
  And yet is but a feeble thing, without strength or control.<br />
  But Thou art almighty for good; yet Thy plagues, they come,<br />
  Hunger and want and disease, in a terrible sum;<br />
  And the poor fathers waste, and are stricken with slow decay;<br />
  And the children fall sick, and are starving, day after day;<br />
  And the hospital wards are choked; and the fire and the flood<br />
  Vex men still, and the leaguered cities are bathed in blood.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ay, yet not the less, O Lord,<br />
  I know Thou art just and art good indeed<br />
  This is it that doth perplex my thought,<br />
  So that I rest not content in any creed.<br />
  If I knew that Thou wert the Lord of Ill,<br />
  Then were I untouched still,<br />
  And, if I would, might worship at Thy shrine;<br />
  Or if my mind might prove no Will Divine<br />
  Inspired the dull mechanical reign of Law.<br />
  But now, while Thou art surely, and art good,<br />
  And wouldst Thy creatures have in happiness,<br />
  Alway the sword, the plague prevail no less,<br />
  Not less, not less Thy laws are based in blood.<br />
  And such deep inequalities of lot<br />
  Confuse our thought, as if Thy hand were not<br />
  All blessings, health and wealth and honours spent<br />
  On some unworthy sordid instrument;<br />
  Thy highest gift of genius flung away<br />
  On some vile thing of meanest clay,<br />
  Who fouls the ingrate lips, touched with Thy fire,<br />
  With worse than common mire:<br />
  How should I fail alone, when all things groan,<br />
  To let my weak voice take a pleading tone!<br />
  How should I speak a comfortable word<br />
  When such things are, O Lord!<br />
</p>

  The blight of fame, the curse of gold;<br />
  Because Thou hast spared my soul as yet,<br />
  Amid the wholesome toil of each swift day,<br />
  The tumult and the fret<br />
  Which carry worldly lives from Thee away.<br />
  I thank Thee for the sorrows Thou hast sent,<br />
  Being in all things content<br />
  To see in every loss a greater gain,<br />
  A joy in every pain;<br />
  The losses I have known, since still I know<br />
  Lives, hidden with Thee, are and grow.<br />
  I do not know, I cannot tell,<br />
  How it may be, yet death and pain are well:<br />
  I know that Thou art good and mild,<br />
  Though sickness take and break the helpless child;<br />
  'Twas Thou, none else, that gav'st the mother's love,<br />
  And even her anguish came from Thee above.<br />
  I am content to be that which Thou wilt:<br />
  Tho' humble be my pathway and obscure,<br />
  Yet from all stain of guilt<br />

  Thy starlit skies whence worlds unnumbered gaze;<br />

  From Thee has come whatever good is ours;&mdash;<br />
  The gift of love that doth exalt the race;<br />
  The gift of childhood with its nameless grace;<br />
  The gift of age which slow through ripe decay,<br />

  The gift of homes happy with honest wealth,<br />

  All these are Thine, and the good gifts of brain,<br />

  SAINT CHRISTOPHER.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Christopher!  There is many a name of Time<br />
  Higher than this in pride and empery;<br />
  There is a name which like a diadem<br />
  Sits on the imperial front, so that men still<br />
  Bow down to Cæsar;&mdash;deathless names enough<br />
  Of bard and sage, soldier and king, which seize<br />
  Our thought, and in one moment bear us forth<br />
  Across the immemorial centuries<br />
  To Time's first dawns&mdash;a bright band set on high,<br />
  Who watch the surging of the restless sea<br />
  Whose waves are generations.  Yet not one<br />
  More strange and quaint and sweet than Christopher's,<br />
  Who bare the Christ.<br />

  Of the old heathen ages lived the man<br />
  Who bore it first.  The elder Pagan gods<br />
  Were paling now, and from the darkling groves<br />
  And hollow aisles of their resounding fanes<br />
  The thin shapes fled for ever.  A new God<br />
  Awoke the souls of men; and yet the shrines<br />
  Of Aphrodité and of Phoebus still<br />
  Drew their own votaries.  The flower of faith,<br />
  Plucked from its roots, and thrown aside to die,<br />
  Is slow to wither, keeping some thin ghost<br />
  And counterfeit of fairness, though the life<br />
  Has fled for ever, and 'twas a dead thing<br />
  To which the Pagan bowed.<br />

  The sluggish brain and stalwart form, and now<br />
  Upon the cripple's limbs setting the crown<br />
  Of godlike wisdom&mdash;gave with generous hand<br />
  Beauty and force to this one, mighty limbs<br />

  Of high adventure called o'er land and sea;<br />
  The magical voice, heard but by nobler souls,<br />

  This great knight-errant showed; a king of men<br />
  Who still before his strong eyes day and night<br />
  Saw power shining star-like on the hills,<br />
  And set his face to gain it.  Luxury<br />
  Held him nor sensual ease who was too great<br />
  For silken fetters, a strong soul and hand<br />
  Bent to a higher end than theirs, and touched<br />
  To higher issues; a fair beacon set<br />
  Upon a lordly hill above the marsh<br />
  Of common life, but all the more laid bare<br />
  To the beating of the whirlwind.<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every soul<br />
  Knows its particular weakness: so for him<br />
  This great strong soul set in its pride of place;<br />
  The charm of Power worked like a spell; high power<br />
  Unchecked, untrammelled, fixed with none to rule<br />
  Above it, this could bend the nobler soul<br />
  Which naught might conquer.  Over land and sea,<br />
  Hiring his mighty arm and strength, he fared<br />
  To sovereign after sovereign, always seeking<br />
  A stronger than the last: until at length<br />
  He found a puissant prince, so high, so great,<br />
  The strong sway held him, and he lived content<br />
  A sleeping soul, not knowing good or ill,<br />
  Resting in act, and with it satisfied&mdash;<br />
  A careless striving soul who sought no more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But midst the miry ways of this sad world,<br />
  As now he fared unmoved, the frequent sight<br />
  Of evil; the blind rage which takes and sways<br />
  The warrior after battle till he quench<br />
  His thirst in blood and torture; the great pain<br />
  Which everywhere cries heavenward, every day<br />
  With unregarded suffrage; the foul wrongs<br />
  Which are done on earth for ever; the dark sins<br />
  Sinned and yet unrequited; the great sum<br />
  And mystery of Evil, worked on him<br />
  Not to allure, not to repel, but only<br />
  With that strange spell of power which knows to take<br />
  The strong soul captive.  Here was power enough,<br />
  Mightier than mortal strength.  The greatest king<br />
  Whom ever he had served compared with this<br />
  Showed puny as a child; this power which took<br />
  The mightiest in chains, now forcing them<br />
  To wrong and blood and ill, now binding them<br />
  With adamant chains within the sensual sty<br />
  Where they lay bound for ever.  Here was force<br />
  To limit Heaven itself.  So this strong soul<br />
  Bowed to it, taking Evil for his lord,<br />
  A voluntary thrall.  Yet not to him<br />
  The smooth foul ways of sense, the paths of wrong,<br />
  Brought pleasure of themselves; only to know<br />
  The unrestrainèd passion surge, a beat<br />
  Of satisfied life, the glory and the glow<br />
  Of full untempered being.  And so long time<br />
  He served the Lord of Evil: deeds of wrong<br />
  And anger, deeds of soft and sensual sin,<br />
  All these he knew, a careless satisfied soul,<br />
  So that for dread of him men named his name<br />
  "The unrighteous;" but he cared not: power and fame<br />
  Sufficed him long, and hid from him the fashion<br />
  Of his own life and by what perilous ways<br />
  He walked, and by what fathomless black seas,<br />
  Abysmal deeps, and treacherous gulphs of Ill.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Till one day as they wandered (so the tale)<br />
  Through a thick wood whence came no gleam of light<br />
  To break the ghostly shadows&mdash;with amaze<br />
  He saw his master the great Lord of Ill<br />
  Cower down as from a blow and hide his eyes<br />
  From some white ghostly figure.  As he gazed<br />
  The old chains fell from him, and with a glance<br />
  He rose up free for ever.  For his soul<br />
  Met that great symbol of all sacrifice<br />
  Which men have worshipped since; the soft sad eyes,<br />
  The agonised limbs nailed to the Tree of Death<br />
  Which is the Tree of Life; and all the past<br />
  Fell from him, and the mystery of Love<br />
  And Death and Evil; Might which gives itself<br />
  To liberate the world and dying breaks<br />
  The vanquished strength of Hell; all these transformed<br />
  His very being, and straightway the strong soul,<br />
  Spurning his ancient chain, stood fair and free<br />
  Alone, a moment with the scars of gyves<br />
  Upon his neck and limbs, and then fell down<br />
  Prostrate upon the earth, the mild eyes still<br />
  Bent on him pitiful.  There he lay stretched<br />
  Through the long night of sorrow, till at last<br />
  The sun rose on his soul, and on the earth,<br />
  And the pure dawn returning brought the day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And when he rose the ancient mastery<br />
  And thirst for power, springing anew in him,<br />
  Once more, resistless, over land and sea<br />
  Impelled him, seeking this new mightier Lord<br />
  Who broke the power of Ill.  So through all lands<br />
  He passed, a passionate pilgrim, but found not<br />
  The Prince he sought, only great princes, strong<br />
  And valorous he found, who bowed them down<br />
  Before the power of Evil; but for them<br />
  He took no thought, who had seen their master blench<br />
  Before the Lord of Light; but him indeed<br />
  He saw not yet; filled with the pride of life,<br />
  A satisfied soul which bowed not down to wrong,<br />
  Touched with desire for good, since good was strong,<br />
  But loving strength alone.<br />

  He came upon a dark and stony land<br />
  Where smiled no flower; there, in a humble cell,<br />
  There dwelt an aged man; no other thing<br />
  Of life was there, only wan age, which dwelt<br />
  Upon the brink of death.  The giant strength<br />
  Was flagging now, while on the distant hills<br />
  The sun was sinking and the gray of night<br />
  Stole upward.  Through the plain beneath the cell<br />
  A broad black river raged, where was no bridge<br />
  For travellers; but a dark road stole to it<br />
  O'ergloomed by cypress, and no boat was there<br />
  Nor ferry, evermore beyond the shade<br />
  Breast-high the strong stream roared by black as death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There sate he on the brink and saw no soul<br />
  As he gazed on the stream of death.  Great misery<br />
  And weakness took him, and he laid him down<br />
  On that cold strand.  Till, when his heart beat slow<br />
  And his life drooped, lo! on the further shore<br />
  The sunset, lingering for a moment, fired<br />
  A thousand palace windows and the spires<br />
  And domes of a fair city; then the night<br />
  Fell downward on them, but the unconquered soul<br />
  Within the failing body leaped and knew<br />
  That it had seen the city of the King.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then swooned he for awhile, and when he knew<br />
  His life again he heard a reverend voice<br />
  Speak through the gloom.  And all the sun had set<br />
  And all the hills were hidden.<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  And when the strong man's strength was come again,<br />
  His old guide led him forth to where the road<br />
  Sank in that black swift stream.  The hills were dark,<br />
  There was no city to see, nought but thick cloud,<br />
  And still that black flood roaring.  Then he heard<br />
  The old voice whisper, "Not of strength alone<br />
  Come they who find the Master, but cast down<br />
  And weak and wandering.  Oftentimes with feet<br />
  Wayworn and weary limbs, they come and pass<br />
  The deeps and are transformed; but he who comes<br />
  Of his own strength from him long time the King<br />
  Hides him as erst from thee.  Yet, because strength<br />
  Well used is a good gift, I bid thee plunge<br />
  In yon cold stream, and seek to wash from thee<br />
  The stains of life.  No harm shall come to thee,<br />
  Nor in those chill dark waters shall thy feet<br />
  Slip, nor thy life be swallowed.  It is thine<br />
  To bear in thy strong arms the fainting souls<br />
  Of pilgrims who press onward day and night<br />
  Seeking the Lord of Light.  Thou, who so long<br />
  Didst serve the Lord of Evil, now shalt serve<br />
  A higher; and because great penances<br />
  Are fitting for great wrong, here shalt thou toil<br />
  Long time till haply thou shalt lose the stain<br />
  Of sense and of the world, then shall thy eyes<br />
  See that thou wouldst.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go suffer and be strong."<br />

<p class="poem">
  Then that strong soul, treading those stony ways,<br />
  Went down into the waters.  Painful souls<br />
  Cried to him from the brink; sad lives, which now<br />
  Had reached their toilsome close; worn wayfarers,<br />
  Who after lifelong strivings and great pain<br />
  And buffetings had gained the perilous stream<br />
  With heaven beyond; wan age and budding youth<br />
  And childhood fallen untimely.  He stooped down<br />
  With wonder mixed with pity, raising up<br />
  The weakling limbs, and bearing in his arms<br />
  The heavy burden, through the chill dark depths<br />
  Of those cold swirling waters without fear<br />
  Strode onward.  Oftentimes the dreadful force<br />
  Of that resistless current, which had whelmed<br />
  A lower soul, bore on him; oftentimes<br />
  The icy cold, too great for feebler hearts,<br />
  Assailed him, yet his mighty stature still<br />
  Strode upright through the deep to the far shore,<br />
  And those poor pilgrims with reviving souls<br />
  Blessed him, and left the waters and grew white<br />
  And glorified, and in their eyes he knew<br />
  A wonder and a rapture as they saw<br />
  The palace of the King, the domes, the spires,<br />
  The shining oriels sunlit into gold,<br />
  The white forms on the brink to welcome them,<br />
  And the clear heights, and the discovered heaven.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But never on his eyes for all his toil<br />
  That bright sun broke, nor those fair palace roofs<br />
  As erst upon his weakness.  Day and night<br />
  The selfsame cloud hung heavy on the hills,<br />
  Blotting the glorious vision.  Day and night<br />
  He laboured unrewarded, with no gleam<br />
  Of that eternal glory, which yet shone<br />
  Upon those fainting souls, whom his strong arms<br />
  Bore upward.  Day and night he laboured still,<br />
  Amid the depths of death.  Ay, he would rise<br />
  At midnight, when the cry of fainting souls<br />
  Called to him on the brink, and so go down<br />
  Without one thought of fear.  Yea, though the floods<br />
  Roared horribly, and deep called unto deep,<br />
  Through all those hidden depths he strode unmoved,<br />
  A strong, laborious, unrewarded soul.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Was it because the stain and blot of wrong<br />
  Were on him still uncleansed?  I cannot tell.<br />
  The stain of ill eats deep, and nought can cleanse it,<br />
  Nay hardly tears of blood.  But to my thought<br />
  Not thus the legend runs; rather I deem<br />
  That what of good he loved was only strength,<br />
  The pride of conscious Power&mdash;that which had led him<br />
  To strong rude wrong, the same sense, working on him,<br />
  Led him through weariness of wrong to use<br />
  His strength for goodness.  Oftentimes Remorse<br />
  Comes not of hatred of the wrong, nor love<br />
  Of the good, but rather from the shame which Pride<br />
  Knows which has gone astray and spent itself<br />
  Upon unworthy ends.  So this strong soul<br />
  Laboured on unfulfilled.  Yet who shall trace<br />
  By what hidden processes of waste and pain<br />
  The great Will is fulfilled, and doth achieve<br />
  The victory of Good?<br />

  Passed, till the giant strength at times would flag<br />
  A little, yet no feebleness was there,<br />
  But still the strong limbs carried him unmoved<br />
  Through those black depths of death.  Till one still night,<br />
  At midnight when the world was sunk in sleep,<br />
  The summons came, "A Pilgrim!" and he saw<br />
  With a new-born compassion, on the shore<br />
  A childish form await him; a soft smile<br />
  Was on the lips, a sweet sad glance divine<br />
  Within the eyes, as in a child's eyes oft<br />
  Knowledge not earthly, infinite weakness, strive<br />
  For mastery.  As the strong man stooped and took<br />
  The weakling to his breast, through the great might<br />
  Of Pity, grown to strength, he took the deep<br />
  With that light load in his arms.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he went,<br />
  The strength greater than human, the strong limbs<br />
  Which bore long time unfaltering the great pain<br />
  And burden of our life; the fearless heart<br />
  Which never blenched before, though the winds beat<br />
  And all the night was blind; these failed him now,<br />
  And as by some o'erwhelming load dragged down,<br />
  His flagging footsteps tottered; the cold wave<br />
  Rose higher around him, the once mighty head<br />
  Bowed-down, the waters rising to his lip<br />
  Engulfed in the depths; the weight of all the earth<br />
  Seemed on his shoulders&mdash;all the sorrow, the sin,<br />
  The burden of the Race&mdash;and a great cry<br />
  Came from him, "Help!  I sink, I faint, I die,<br />
  I perish beneath my burden!  Help, O King<br />
  Of Heaven, for I am spent and can no more!<br />
  My strength is gone, the waters cover me,<br />
  I stand not of myself.  Help, Lord and King!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then suddenly from his spent life he felt<br />
  The great load taken; through the midnight gloom<br />
  There burst the glorious vision of his dream&mdash;<br />
  The palace of the King, the domes, the spires,<br />
  The shining oriels sunlit into gold,<br />
  The heaven of heavens discovered; then a voice,<br />
  "Rise, Christopher! thou hast found thy King, and turn<br />
  Back to the earth, for I have need of thee.<br />
  Thou hast sustained the whole world, bearing me<br />
  The Lord of Earth and Heaven.  Rise, turn awhile<br />
  To the old shore of Time; I am the Prince<br />
  Thou seekest; I a little child, the King<br />
  Of Earth and Heaven.  I have marked thy toils,<br />
  Labours, and sorrows; I have seen thy sins,<br />
  Thy tears, and thy repentance.  Rise and be<br />
  My Servant always.  And if thou shalt seek<br />
  A sign of me, I give this sign to thee:<br />
  Set thou thy staff to-night upon the verge<br />
  Of these dark waters, and with early dawn<br />
  Seek it, and thou shalt find it blossomed forth<br />
  Into such sweet white blooms as year by year<br />
  The resurrection of the springtide brings<br />
  To clothe the waste of winter.  This shall be<br />
  The sign of what has been."<br />

<h3>
  CLYTÆMNESTRA IN PARIS.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I seemed to pace the dreadful corridors<br />
  Of a still foreign prison, blank and white,<br />
  And in a bare and solitary cell<br />
  To find a lonely woman, soft of voice<br />
  And mild of eye, who never till life's end<br />
  Should pass those frowning gates.  Methought I asked her<br />
  The story of her crime, and what hard fate<br />
  Left her, so gentle seeming, fettered there,<br />
  Hopeless, a murderess at whose very name<br />
  Men shuddered still.  And to my questioning<br />
  Methought that dreadful soul made answer thus:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Yes, I suppose I liked him, though I know not;<br />
  I hardly know what love may be; how should I?&mdash;<br />
  I a young girl wedded without my will,<br />
  As is our custom here, to a man old,<br />
  Not perhaps in years, but dark experiences.<br />
  What had we two in common, that worn man,<br />
  And I, an untrained girl?  It was not strange<br />
  If when that shallow boy, with his bold tongue,<br />
  And his gay eyes, and curls, and budding beard,<br />
  Flattered me, I was weak.  I think all women<br />
  Are weak sometimes, and overprone to love<br />
  When the man is young, and straight, and 'twas a triumph<br />
  To see the disappointed envious jades<br />
  Wince as he passed them carelessly, nor heeded<br />
  Their shallow wiles to trap him,&mdash;ay, a triumph!<br />
  And that was all; I hardly know, indeed,<br />
  If it was love that drove, or only pride<br />
  To hold what others grudged me.  Vain he was,<br />
  And selfish, and a coward, as you shall hear,<br />
  Handsome enough, I grant you, to betray<br />
  A stronger soul than mine.  Indeed, I think,<br />
  He never cared for me nor I for him<br />
  (For there were others after him): I knew it,<br />
  Then chiefest, when our comedy of life<br />
  Was turning at the last to tragedy.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Now that I was unfaithful, a false wife,<br />
  I value not men's sneers at a pin's point,<br />
  We have a right to love and to be loved;<br />
  Not the mere careless tolerance of the spouse<br />
  Who has none to give.  True, if I were a nun,<br />
  Vowed to a white and cloistered life, no doubt<br />
  'Twere otherwise.  They tell me there are women<br />
  Who are so rapt by thoughts of the poor, of churches,<br />
  Of public ends, of charity, of schools,<br />
  Of Heaven knows what, they live their lives untouched<br />
  By passion; but for us, who are but women,<br />
  Not bred on moonlight, perhaps of common clay,<br />
  Untrained for aught but common bourgeois life,<br />
  Life is no mystical pale procession winding<br />
  Its way from the cradle to the grave, but rather<br />
  A thing of hot swift flushes, fierce delights,<br />
  Good eating, dances, wines, and all the rest,<br />
  When the occasion comes.  I never loved him,<br />
  I tell you; therefore, perhaps, I did no sin.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But when this fellow must presume to boast,<br />
  Grow cold, have scruples for his soul and mine,<br />
  And turn to other younger lives, and pass<br />
  My door to-day with this one, then with that,<br />
  And all the gossips of the quarter sneered,<br />
  And knew I was deserted, do you think it<br />
  A wonder that my eyes, opened at last,<br />
  Saw all the folly and the wickedness<br />
  (If sweet it were, where were the wickedness?)<br />
  Which bore such bitter fruit?  Think you it strange<br />
  That I should turn for aid, ay, and revenge,<br />
  To my wronged spouse&mdash;if wronged he be, indeed,<br />
  Who doth consent as he did?  When I told him,<br />
  Amid my tears, he made but small pretence<br />
  Of jealousy at all; only his pride<br />
  Was perhaps a little wounded.  And indeed<br />
  It took such long confessions, such grave pain<br />
  Of soul, such agony of remorse of mine<br />
  To move him but a little, that I grew<br />
  So weary of it all, it almost checked<br />
  My penitence, and left me free to choose<br />
  Another for my love; but at the last,<br />
  Long labour, feigned reports, the neighbours' sneers,<br />
  These drove him at the last, good easy man,<br />
  To such a depth of hatred, that my task<br />
  Grew lighter, and my heart.<br />
</p>

  Loving appeals, recalling our past days<br />
  Together; and I wrote them, using all<br />
  The armoury of loving cozening words<br />
  With which craft arms us women: but in vain,<br />
  For whether some new love engrossed, or whether<br />
  He wearied of me and my love, I know not,<br />
  Only, in spite of all, no answer came.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "At length, since I could get no word from him,<br />
  My husband bade me write&mdash;or was it I<br />
  Who thought of the device?  Pray you believe me,<br />
  I would speak nothing else than the whole truth,<br />
  But these sad dreadful deeds confuse the brain.<br />
  Well, perhaps 'twas I, who knew his weakness well<br />
  I do not know, but somehow it came to pass<br />
  I wrote a crafty letter, begging of him,<br />
  By all our former kindness, former wrong,<br />
  If for the last time, recognizing well<br />
  That all was done between us evermore,<br />
  We might, for one last evening, meet and part<br />
  And, knowing he was needy, and his greed,&mdash;<br />
  'If only he would come,' I wrote to him,<br />
  'I had some secret savings, and desired&mdash;<br />
  For what need comes there closer than a friend's?&mdash;<br />
  To help him in his trouble.'<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift there came&mdash;<br />
  The viper!&mdash;hypocritical words of love:<br />
  Yes, he would come, for the old love still lived,<br />
  He knew it, ah, too well; not all the glamour<br />
  Of other eyes and lips could ever quench<br />
  The fire of that mad passion.  He would come,<br />
  Loving as ever, longing for the day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Now when we had the answer, straight we three&mdash;<br />
  My husband and myself, and his weak brother,<br />
  Whose daughter to her first communion went<br />
  That very day,&mdash;and I, too, took the Host<br />
  As earnest of changed life,&mdash;we three, I say,<br />
  At a little feast we made to celebrate<br />
  The brothers reconciled (in families<br />
  There come dissensions, as you know), devised<br />
  His punishment.  We hired, in a still suburb,<br />
  A cottage standing backward from the street,<br />
  Beyond an avenue of sycamores;<br />
  A lonely place, unnoticed.  Day by day<br />
  We went, we three together&mdash;for I feared<br />
  Lest, if there were no third, the strength of youth<br />
  Might bear my husband down&mdash;we went to make<br />
  All needful preparations.  First we spread<br />
  Over all the floor a colour like to blood,<br />
  For deep's the stain of blood, and what shall cleanse it?<br />
  Also, my husband, from a neighbouring wood,<br />
  Had brought a boar-trap, sharp with cruel knives<br />
  And jaggèd teeth, to close with a snap and tear<br />
  The wild beast caught within it.  But I deemed<br />
  The risk too great, the prey might slip away;<br />
  Therefore, that he might meet his punishment,<br />
  And to prevent the sound of cries and groans,<br />
  My husband fashioned for his lips a gag,<br />
  And on the mantel left it, and the means<br />
  To strike a light.  And being thus prepared,<br />
  We three returned to Paris; there long time<br />
  We sate eating and drinking of the best,<br />
  As those do who have taken a resolve<br />
  Whence no escape is, save to do and die.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then the two men went back and left me there,<br />
  With all my part to do.  It was an hour<br />
  Or more before the time when my poor dupe<br />
  Had fixed to meet me.  Wandering thus alone<br />
  Through the old streets, seeing the common sights<br />
  Of every day, the innocent child-faces<br />
  Homing from school, so like my little ones,<br />
  I seemed to lose all count of time.  At length,<br />
  Because it was the Ascension Feast, there came<br />
  A waft of music from the open doors<br />
  Of a near church, and, entering in, I found<br />
  The incensed air, all I remembered well&mdash;<br />
  The lights, the soaring chants, the kneeling crowds,<br />
  When I believed and knelt.  They seemed to soothe<br />
  My half bewildered fancy, and I thought&mdash;<br />
  What if a woman, who mayhap had sinned<br />
  But lightly, wishing to repair her wrong,<br />
  And bound thereby to some dark daring deed<br />
  Of peril, should come here, and kneel awhile,<br />
  And ask a blessing for the deed, of her<br />
  Who is Heaven's Queen and knows our weaknesses<br />
  Being herself a woman!  So I knelt<br />
  In worship, and the soaring voices clear<br />
  And the dim heights and worship-laden air<br />
  Filled me with comfort for my soul, and nerved<br />
  My failing heart, and winged time's lagging flight,<br />
  Till lo the hour was come when I should go<br />
  To meet him for the last time.<br />

  The city far behind, the sweet May night<br />
  Was falling on the quiet village street;<br />
  There was a scent of hawthorn on the air<br />
  As we passed on with feint of loving words,&mdash;<br />
  Passed slow like lovers to the appointed place,<br />
  Passed to the place of punishment and doom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But when we reached the darkling avenue<br />
  Of sycamores, which to the silent house<br />
  Led through a palpable gloom, I felt him shudder<br />
  With some blind vague presentiment of ill,<br />
  And he would go no further; but I clung<br />
  Around him close, laughed all his fear to scorn,<br />
  Whispered words in his ear, and step by step,<br />
  My soul on reparation being set,<br />
  Drew him reluctant to the fated door<br />
  Where lay my spouse in ambush, and swift death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I think I hear the dreadful noise of the key,<br />
  Turning within the disused lock, the hall<br />
  Breathing a false desertion, the loud sound<br />
  Of both our footsteps echoing through the house.<br />
  I could not choose but tremble.  Yet I knew<br />
  'Twas but a foolish weakness.  Then I struck<br />
  A match, and in the burst of sudden light<br />
  I saw the ruddy cheek grown ashy pale,<br />
  And as he doffed his hat, I marked the curls<br />
  On his white forehead, and the boyish grace<br />
  Which hung around him still, and almost felt<br />
  Compassion.  Then the darkness came again,<br />
  And hid him, and I groped to find his hand,<br />
  Clutched it with mine, and led him to the door.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But when within the darkling room we were<br />
  Where swift death waited him, not dalliance,<br />
  Three times my trembling fingers failed to wake<br />
  The twinkling light which scarce could pierce the gloom<br />
  Which hid my husband.  Oh, to see his face<br />
  When the dark aspect and the furious eyes<br />
  Glared out on him!  'I am lost!' he cried, 'I am lost!'<br />
  And then the sound of swift and desperate fight<br />
  And a death struggle.  Listening, as I stood<br />
  Without, with that mean craven hound, our brother,<br />
  I heard low cries of rage, and knew despair<br />
  And youth had nerved the unarmed in such sort<br />
  As made the conflict doubtful.  Then I rushed<br />
  Between them, threw my arms around him, clogged<br />
  His force and held him fast, crying the while,<br />
  'Wretch, would you kill my husband!'&mdash;held him fast,<br />
  As coils a serpent round the escaping deer,<br />
  Until my husband, hissing forth his hate,<br />
  'Villain, I pierce thy heart as thou hast mine,'<br />
  Stabbed through and through his heart.<br />

  The lonely road, beneath the dreadful stars!<br />
  To the swift stream, we three&mdash;nay, nay, we four&mdash;<br />
  One on the child's poor carriage covered o'er,<br />
  And three who drew him onward, on the road,<br />
  That dead thing, having neither eye nor ear,<br />
  Which late was full of life, and strife, and hate.<br />
  On that dumb silence, came no wayfarer,<br />
  And once the covering which concealed our load<br />
  Slipped down, and left the ghastly blood-stained thing<br />
  Open to prying eyes, but none were there;<br />
  And then the darkling river, and the sound<br />
  When, with lead coiled around it, the dead corpse<br />
  Sank with a sullen plunge within the deep,<br />
  And took with it the tokens of our crime.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then with a something of relief, as those<br />
  Who have passed through some great peril all unharmed,<br />
  We went and burned the blood-stained signs of death,<br />
  And left the dreadful place, and once more sped<br />
  To Paris and to sleep, till the new day,<br />
  Now risen to high noon, touched our sad dreams.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And that day, since we could not work as yet,<br />
  We to the Picture Gallery went, and there<br />
  We took our fill of nude voluptuous limbs,<br />
  Mingled with scenes of horror bathed in blood,<br />
  Such as our painters love.  So week by week,<br />
  Careless and unafraid, we spent our days,<br />
  Till when that sad night faded; swift there rose,<br />
  Bursting the weights that kept it, the pale corpse,<br />
  A damning witness from the deep, and brought<br />
  The dreadful past again, and with it doom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You know how we were tried, and how things went,<br />
  The cozening speeches, the brow-beating judge,<br />
  The petty crafts which make the pleader's art,<br />
  The dolts who sit in judgment, when the one<br />
  Who knows all must be silent; but you know not<br />
  The intolerable burden of suspense,<br />
  The hard and hateful gaze of hungry eyes<br />
  Which gloat upon your suffering.  When doom came<br />
  It was well to know the worst, and hear no more<br />
  The half-forgotten horrors.  But I think<br />
  The sense of common peril, common wrong,<br />
  Knits us in indissoluble unity,<br />
  Closer than years of converse.  When my husband,<br />
  Braving his doom, embraced me as he went;<br />
  'Wife, so thou live I care not,' all my heart<br />
  Went out to him for a moment, and I cried,<br />
  'Let me die too, my guilt is more than his.'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Some quibble marred the sentence, and once more<br />
  The miserable tale was told afresh:<br />
  Once more I stood before those hungry eyes,<br />
  And when 'twas done we went forth slaves for life,<br />
  Both with an equal doom, and ever since<br />
  We suffer the same pains in solitude,<br />
  Slaves fettered fast, whom only death sets free.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "That is my tale told truly.  Now you know,<br />
  Sir, of what fashion I am made: a woman<br />
  Gentle, you see, and mild eyed.  If I sinned<br />
  Surely there was temptation, and I sought<br />
  Such reparation as I could.  There are here<br />
  Tigresses, and not women, black of brow<br />
  And strong of arm, who have struck down or stabbed<br />
  Husband, or child, or lover, not as I,<br />
  But driven by rage and jealousy, and drink!<br />
  These creatures of the devil, as I pass<br />
  I see them shrink and shudder.  The young priest<br />
  Of the prison, a well-favoured lad he is,<br />
  When I confessed to him bore on his brow<br />
  Cold drops of agony; the Sister grew<br />
  So pale at what I told her, that I thought<br />
  She was like to swoon away, until I soothed her.<br />
  Poor wretch, she has much to learn; and here I am,<br />
  And shall be till my hair turns grey, my eyes<br />
  Grow dim, and I have clean forgotten all<br />
  That brought me here, and all my former life<br />
  Fades like a once-heard tale.  In the long nights,<br />
  As I lie alone in my cell like any nun,<br />
  I wake sometimes with a start, and seem to hear<br />
  That rusty lock turn, and those echoing feet<br />
  Down that dark passage, and I seem to see<br />
  The dreadful stare of those despairing eyes,<br />
  And then there sounds, a plunge in the deep, and I<br />
  Lie shivering till the dawn.  I have no comfort<br />
  Except the holy Mass; for see you, sir,<br />
  I was devout until they scoffed at me.<br />
  And now I know there is a hell indeed,<br />
  Since this place is on earth.  I do not think<br />
  I have much cause to fear death, should it come;<br />
  For whoso strives for Duty, all the Saints<br />
  And the Madonna needs must love, and I,<br />
  I have done what penitence could do; and here<br />
  What have I of reward?&mdash;my children taken<br />
  As clean from me as if they were dead indeed,<br />
  Trained to forget their mother.  Sir, I see,<br />
  Beyond these shallow phantasms of life;<br />
  And this I hold, that one whose conscience shows<br />
  As clear as mine must needs be justified.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I love the holy Mass, and take the Host<br />
  As often as I may, being of good heart.<br />
  For what was it she did in Holy Writ,<br />
  The Kenite's wife of old?  I do not read<br />
  That women shrunk from her because she drave<br />
  The nail through her guest's brain; nay, rather, praise<br />
  Was hers: yet was she not betrayed as I,<br />
  Nor yet repentant of her wrong and seeking<br />
  To do what good was left.  But look you, sir,<br />
  If I was once repentant, that is past:<br />
  I hate those black-browed women, who turn from me,<br />
  That smooth priest and that poor fool with her cross,<br />
  And that strange pink-and-whiteness of the nun.<br />
  And sometimes when they come I let them hear<br />
  Such things as make the pious hypocrites turn<br />
  And cross themselves.  And for this tigress crew,<br />
  If I might only steal to their cells at night<br />
  With a knife, I would teach them, what it is to stab;<br />
  Or even without one, that these little hands<br />
  Can strangle with the best.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, you draw back,<br />
  You too are shocked forsooth.  Listen, you wretch,<br />
  Who are walking free while I am prisoned here:<br />
  How many thoughts of murder have you nursed<br />
  Within your miserable heart! how many<br />
  Low, foul desires which would degrade the brute!<br />
  Do you think I do not know you men?  What was it<br />
  That kept your hands unstained, but accident?&mdash;<br />
  Accident, did I say? or was it rather<br />
  Cowardice, that you feared the stripes of the law,<br />
  And did not dare to do your will or die?&mdash;<br />
  Accident! then, I pray you, where the merit<br />
  To have abstained?  Or if you claim, indeed,<br />
  Such precious self-restraint as keeps your feet<br />
  From straying, where the credit? since it came<br />
  A gift as much unearned as other's ill,<br />
  Which lurked for them a little tiny speck<br />
  Hidden in the convolutions of the brain,<br />
  To grow with their growth, and wax with their years, and leave<br />
  The wretch at last in Hell.  Do you deem it just,<br />
  The Potter with our clay upon His wheel<br />
  Should shape it in such form?  I love not God,<br />
  Being such; I hate Him rather: I, His creature,<br />
  I do impugn His justice or His power,<br />
  I will not feign obedience&mdash;I, a woman,<br />
  Of a soft nature, who would love my love,<br />
  And my child, and nothing more; who am, instead,<br />
  A murderess, as they tell me, pining here<br />
  In hell before my time."<br />

  With horror and despair; and as I passed<br />
  The crucifix within the corridor,<br />

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
